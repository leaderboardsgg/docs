# A propos

## Qui sommes-nous ?
Nous sommes des speedrunners, des modérateurs, des personnes haut placées dans nos communautés de speedrunning, des personnes qui ont à cœur de remettre les outils que nous utilisons entre nos mains.

## What Are You Building?
We are working on two projects:
* An updated and improved Speedrun Leaderboard API/DB that:
  * (Final name to be decided)
  * Takes advantage of current technologies
  * Has good documentation
  * Is a pleasure to use for the end user
  * is powerful enough that externally hosted leaderboards can use them to power their own leaderboards, which would allow an up to date database of runs, no matter what website you are on.
  * Solves the problem of:
    * Insert Issues People Bring Up Here Maybe?
* A new centralized Speedrun Leaderboard Website that:
  * (Final name to be decided)
  * Improves the user experience for:
    * Board Mods
      * Current website has no tools to bulk move run entries.
    * Individual Runners
    * Curious Fans
  * Solves the problem of:
    * Insert Issues People Bring Up Here Maybe?
